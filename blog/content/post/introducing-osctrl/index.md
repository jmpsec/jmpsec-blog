## What is osctrl?

[osctrl](https://osctrl.net) is a fast and efficient [osquery](https://osquery.io/) management solution, implementing its [remote API](https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deployment/remote/) as TLS endpoint. It offers a scalable and reliable service that will help enhance your incident response and detection capabilities, by following a model where critical functions are split into different components.

* Distribute [osquery](https://osquery.io/) configuration fast across all your enrolled nodes,

* Collect all the status and result logs, whether you want to store them or forward them to a different system ([Splunk](https://www.splunk.com), [ELK](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack), [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), [Graylog](https://www.graylog.org/)‚Ä¶ ),

* Run quasi-real-time on-demand queries in your selected enrolled nodes,
